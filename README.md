The data was gathered from Roches Point station (Cork) and 5 years of weather historical data from that station was used to build the model. The variables used to predict the temperature were: Wet Bulb Air Temperature, Dew Point Air Temperature, Relativity Humidity, Mean Sea Level Pressure, Mean Hourly Wind Speed, Predominant Hourly wind Direction. One step ahead was forecasted in order to calculate and predict the Growing Degrees Days for Perennial Ryegrass for 2022. The model used was Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors.
